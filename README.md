# James Featherston's Portfolio Website

## Description

Hello! 

I am currently a sophmore at the University of Texas at Austin looking to become a Software Engineer. This upcoming summer I will be interning at Meta as a Software Engineer. As an aspiring Software Engineer, I decided I need a website to display all of my projects and what I have learned from these projects.

This website serves not only to please recruiters, but to hopefully motivate me to work on some more projects and make cool things. 

Right now, this website is a work in progress and I intend to add a lot more projects to it this semester.
